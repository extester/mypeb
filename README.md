## Installation ##

Run the following commands:

```bash
phpize
./configure --help
./configure
make
make install
```

## Note ##

You can specify the location of both Erlang interface libraries and Erlang interface header files by using `--with-erlang=DIR`. The configure script will look for libraries and headers in DIR/lib and DIR/include respectively. In case libraries and headers do not share a common parent directory, use `--with-erlanglib=LIB` and `--with-erlanginc=INCLUDE` instead.

For example with a default installation of Erlang from the `ESL Erlang Packages` on a Mac you can run `configure` like this:

```bash
./configure --with-erlanglib=/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/erl_interface-3.7.11/lib/ --with-erlanginc=/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/erl_interface-3.7.11/include/
```
